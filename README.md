# Aimbot2021

Aimbot implementation for RM2021

## Features

* Armor detection with number recognition
* Asynchronized serial communication

## Prerequisites

* [Daheng Galaxy USB3.0 driver](./docs/cam_driver_install.md)

* [OpenCV (Tested with 3.4.14)](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.14/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)

* Boost

  ```shell
  sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
  ```

## Build the project

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

After the building process is done, the generated executables will be put in `bin/` and static libraries will be put in `lib/`.

## Get Started

* [Acquire camera image](./docs/acquire_cam_image.md)
* [Camera calibration](./docs/camera_calibration.md)
* [Run detection algorithm](./docs/run_detection_algorithm.md)
* [Communication with STM32 board via serial](./docs/serial_communication.md)

## Framework

* Design concept:

  Every directory under `src/` will compile as a static library that provides certain function. When writing application code (such as those in `sample/`), you just link your code to the library according to the function you want. All project is organized with CMake, you may want to refer to [《CMake Cookbook》](https://github.com/xiaoweiChen/CMake-Cookbook/releases/download/0.2/CMake-CookBook.pdf) for CMake learning.
